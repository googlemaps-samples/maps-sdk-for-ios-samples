# Google Maps SDK for iOS, Google Places SDK for iOS, and Google Navigation SDK for iOS sample code

## Description

This repository provides one or more samples demonstrating use of various **iOS SDKs** in the Google Maps Platform.

## Samples in this repo

This repository contains sample code for use with the

- [Google Maps SDK for iOS][ios-sdk]
- [Google Places SDK for iOS](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk), and
- [Google Navigation SDK for iOS](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk)

## Requirements

To run the samples, you will need:

- To [sign up with Google Maps Platform]
- A Google Maps Platform [project] with the relevant SDK enabled
- An [API key] associated with the project above ... follow the [API key instructions] if you're new to the process
- Swift or Objective-C
- Xcode 15+
- (Deployment target of) iOS 15+

## GoogleMaps

The `GoogleMaps` and `GoogleMaps-Swift` sub-directory contains the sample code that is downloaded
when you run `pod try GoogleMaps`. To use this project:

For Objective-C samples:

```
$ cd GoogleMaps
$ pod install
$ open GoogleMapsDemos.xcworkspace
```

For Swift (UIKit) samples:

```
$ cd GoogleMaps-Swift
$ pod install
$ open GoogleMapsSwiftDemos.xcworkspace
```

Add your API Key to `GoogleMapsDemos/SDKDemoAPIKey.h`.

## GoogleMaps-SwiftUI

The `GoogleMaps-SwiftUI` sub-directory contains sample code demonstrating how to integrate Google Maps SDK with SwiftUI applications. It provides a modern SwiftUI wrapper around `GMSMapView` with a declarative API for common map configurations and interactions. To use this project:

```
$ cd GoogleMaps-SwiftUI
$ open GoogleMaps-SwiftUI.xcodeproj
```

This project uses Swift Package Manager and requires the [GoogleMaps package](https://github.com/googlemaps/ios-maps-sdk). The sample code demonstrates best practices for integrating Google Maps into SwiftUI-based iOS applications.

## GooglePlaces

The `GooglePlaces` and `GooglePlaces-Swift` sub-directory contains the sample code that is downloaded
when you run `pod try GooglePlaces`. To use this project:

```
$ cd GooglePlaces
$ pod install
$ open GooglePlacesDemos.xcworkspace
```

For Swift samples:

```
$ cd GooglePlaces-Swift
$ pod install
$ open GooglePlacesSwiftDemos.xcworkspace
```

Add your API Key to `GooglePlacesDemos/SDKDemoAPIKey.h`.

## GoogleNavigation

The `GoogleNavigation` and `GoogleNavigation-Swift` sub-directory contains the sample code that is downloaded
when you run `pod try GoogleNavigation`. To use this project:

```
$ cd GoogleNavigation
$ pod install
$ open GoogleNavigationDemos.xcworkspace
```

For Swift samples:

```
$ cd GoogleNavigation-Swift
$ pod install
$ open GoogleNavigationSwiftDemos.xcworkspace
```

Add your API Key to `GoogleNavigationDemos/SDKDemoAPIKey.h`.

## MapsAndPlacesDemo

This demo application looks to bridge some of the features found in the GooglePlaces and GoogleMaps demo applications as well as utilize some of the ways the two API's can work together.
Click this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4Ih8EWqZio) to watch a video demonstration.

- If you are emulating this from you Mac, please make sure to set the emulated phone's location (otherwise, location features will not work)
- A [Google Cloud Platform API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/start#get-key) with Maps SDK for iOS and Places SDK for iOS enabled
- A light and dark themed map, which can be created [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis/client-styles?project=verdant-medium-278819&folder=&organizationId=) (make sure you sign in first)
- If you want a different data set, ensure that it follows the correct formatting (and is also a JSON file) like the one provided (the data set provided can be found in dataset.json)

### Installation
1. Make sure you are in the right folder (MapsAndPlacesDemo)
2. Run `pod install`
3. Open `MapsAndPlacesDemo.xcworkspace`
4. Drag the data set (dataset.json) into the Xcode file explorer (left pane)

## Tutorials

The `tutorials` sub-directory contains sample code that accompanies tutorials in the developer
documentation, such as
[Adding a Map with a Marker](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/map-with-marker),
and more. Follow the tutorials for a quick guide to using the SDK.

## Snippets

The `snippets` sub-directory contains code snippets that can be found in the developer documentation site.
